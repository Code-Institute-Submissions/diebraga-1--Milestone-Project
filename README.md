## libraries
<pre>
* Yup:  it'ss a javascript object schema validation builder, in an object shape which 
matches the values inputed for a validation, it can be used in both cases with 
a HTML validation or separetly.
https://github.com/jquense/yup

* Styled Components:  it's a CSS library that allow us to wrap all CSS styles in
a `var` that can be exported to our HTML pages as a react component. Syntax EX:


import styled from 'styled-components';                  import React from 'react';
                                                         
export const Container = styled.div`         **=>**      import { Container } from '../../_styles_css/explore/styles';
  p {                                                    
    font-weight: bold;                                   const HelloWorld: React.FC = () => {
    }                                                     return (
`;                                                          <Container>
                                                              **ReactJs**
                                                            </Container>
                                                           );
                                                         };
                                                         
                                                         export default HelloWorld;

For each element wrapped inside <Container> which is already an HTML tag in this case a `div` 
styled components already creates a unique class wich makes it way easy to work on, isolating 
the elements that you wanna apply styles.
  
* Jest:  it's a testing library that helps you to write tests in your application in a fast and
easy way.

## Testing

    **All components in the app are tested in unit tests using jest**
    1. Go in the project folder and run: `yarn test` or `npm test` in your terminal.
      -   Input element.
          ‚àö should be able to render an input
              ‚àö should be able to render an input
      -   Button element
          ‚àö should be able to render button 
      -   Card element
          ‚àö should be able to render cards
      -   Navbar component
          ‚àö should be able to render navbar correctly
      -   Footer component
          ‚àö should be able to render footer correctly 
       
   
   <pre>
   Route Links in the app are mocked too.
   
   All links are workng/ not broken.
  
   I tested the app manually on a variaty of browsers:
   
   Chrome
   Brave
   Edge
   FireFox
   
   and mobile:
   
   Iphone 10
   Sansung Galaxy S7
   
   Using the inspector I tested responsivity in variety of screen sizes.
   
There are `console.log()`s as a test if the information has been sent or not in the forms.
a validation returns the information and the possible errors.

Forms:
  1. Go to "/", "/register" or "/login" pages, right click and inspect and sonsole.
  2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error 
  message about the required fields 
  appears in the console and input.
  3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error 
  message appears in the console and input.
  4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a no errors message appears 
  in your console and input.
